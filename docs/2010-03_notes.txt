So have tool for "Display Paths by End Nodes".
Next need tool to highlight paths by Edges.  Select Paths and Centroid Nodes involved.

"Display Paths by End Nodes"
  Where is the path between these patches?

"Display Paths by Edges"
  To what paths and patches is this edge connect
  * check that path to edges is correct based on network.txt

Getting wierd zig-zags
 -> parameterize default cost over different edges in create_network.py
    eweights = {'internal':0.8, 'perimeter':0.9, 'external':1, 'boundary':1}  # tweaking this has major implications, particularly for internal edges
Add 

Then tweak complexity.

Could build into GDB with nodes, edges and paths using relationship classes.

 * Damn!  I was using feat.length as weight, but this is only in 2D!?!
   So now calculating LengthXYZ
   -> so go with euclidean distance * weight-by-type (internal/perimeter/external/boundary) + costdist

 * Damn!  Extra zigs and zags not part of paths, b/c lc network based on subgraph of nbunch, not add_edge.
   -> so fixed by doing true subgraph based on edges, not nodes
   -> perhaps downweight interior edges by 0.5?

trying to use interactive Feature Set selection.

  * NodeID 2643, 2423

  * "FromNode" IN (2699, 2643) AND "ToNode" IN (2699, 2643)

  * strange zig-zags, so need to penalize internal, perimeter with Euclidean cost
    ensure matrix costs are at least Euclidean (additive?)

 * tweak TIN creation
