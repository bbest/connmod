questions:
 - FIX: what are the boundary edges doing on interior for CONN_02062008\fr_OUT_55km\7700ha?
 - FIX: why are paths repeated fromnode <-> tonode?
   - create csv first, then check for # records in dbf
 - FIX!: absolute paths in network.txt description, change to relative paths like *.mxd
 - FIX: centroids missing in resulting network after least-cost paths if no neighbors
 - FIX: 55,000 m -> 55000 m: comma bad for now
 
history: 
 * cleaned up wd.replace stuff, and check of paths in create_network.py
   * TODO: others
 * variable costthreshold allowed
 
networks by membership
 - inclusion by attribute field
 - faster rendering of lc paths edges:
   "tr_lc" =1 AND "EdgeType" IN ( 'boundary', 'external')

paths by relationship
 - 1 edge to many paths
 - relate paths.dbf to edges
